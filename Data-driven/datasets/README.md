For the Burgers, Advection, and Darcy problems, download the corresponding datasets from this [link](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/lu_lu_yale_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Flu%5Flu%5Fyale%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fdatasets%2F2022%5FCMAME%5FLu&ga=1). Within that link, each problem corresponds to the following:
- Burgers -> *Burgers*.
- Advection -> *advection_I_II*.
- Darcy -> *Darcy_PWC*.

The dataset for the Structural Mechanics problem can be found at this [link](https://data.caltech.edu/records/fp3ds-kej20).
The dataset for our LDC problem is already provided in the folder.
